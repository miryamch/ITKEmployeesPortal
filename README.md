# jsfproject
I created this project to help me learn Java EE, JavaServer Faces and PrimeFaces. 
The appliation is a company's internal portal destined to employees. 
The web-site has four main pages: a news feed, a phone book, a cantine menu and a classified ads page. 
The application retrievs information (phone book + menu) from a mSQL database using the Hibernate framework. Check the src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml for the configuration (db url, username and password). 
You can fill an empty data base with some sample data by executing the file fillDatabase.java in package com.itk.chaabouni.dao.
